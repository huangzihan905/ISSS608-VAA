Through a blend of network analysis, exploratory data visualization, and forecasting tools, the app offers music analysts, researchers, and enthusiasts a novel lens to uncover deep-rooted connections among artists, genres, and songs over time.\n\nUsers can examine the genre distribution of Oceanus Folk music, spot trends in collaborations and emerging artists, and track the evolution of significant artists like Sailor Shift within their network with this dashboard. The program provides deep insights from complex musical data in an easy-to-understand and visually appealing way by combining interactive filters, edge-node analysis, and PCA clustering.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe goal of this project is to model and examine the complex evolution of musical genres and artist relationships, drawing inspiration from the complexity of real-world music ecosystems. Oceanus Folk, a genre experiencing dynamic growth and genre blending, serves as the central node to explore influence propagation, cross-genre collaborations, and artist trajectory predictions. The goal is to create a comprehensive decision-support tool for talent scouts and music researchers.\n\n# Methodology\n\nThe dashboard was developed using the R Shiny framework and built on a JSON-based musical knowledge graph. The methodology involved the following key steps:\n\n-   Data Parsing: JSON data containing nodes (songs, artists, labels) and links (influences, roles) was parsed using `jsonlite` and `tidygraph`.\n-   Data Cleaning & Transformation: The dataset was cleaned with `janitor` and pre-processed into tidy tables for songs, edges, and nodes.\n-   Interactive Visualizations: Plots were rendered using `ggplot2`, `plotly`, and `visNetwork` to enable user-driven analysis.\n-   User Inputs: Select inputs like year sliders and genre filters dynamically update the content.\n-   Forecasting & Clustering: PCA and radar plots were used to identify potential rising stars based on musical features and influence scores.\n\n# Storyboard\n\n## Overview\n\nThe application is structured into three major analytical modules: **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Influence Network Exploration**, and **Rising Star Forecasting**. Each module contains multiple sub-tabs that enable users to drill down into specific insights such as edge type distributions, node classifications, genre trends, influence networks, and artist projections.\n\nThe user journey begins with a broad exploration of data structure — understanding the relationships (edges), entities (nodes), and genre presence. Users can then move on to specialized influence networks focused on Sailor Shift and Oceanus Folk. Lastly, the application provides forward-looking visualizations to discover promising rising stars.\n\nA consistent layout is maintained across all tabs with sidebar selectors (year range, genre count, artist cluster) and responsive main panels that reactively update visualizations based on user input. This ensures seamless user experience and high analytical flexibility.\n\n## Image Dashboard Explanations\n\n### 1. Edge and Node Type Distribution (EDA Tabs 5.1 & 5.2)\n\nIn the \"Edge Type Count\" tab, users can observe the frequency of relationship types between entities in the knowledge graph. For instance, PerformerOf is the most dominant edge type, indicating a high number of artist-to-song relationships. This allows users to infer which types of musical connections (e.g., lyrical reference, sampling, performance) are most prevalent and thus potentially more influential in shaping genre evolution.\n\n![Fig1. Edge Type Count](images/1.png)\n\nUsers can observe the split of node types, including Person, Song, Album, and MusicalGroup, under the \"Node Type Count\" tab. This helps users in comprehending the makeup of the dataset and concentrating their investigation on particular entity categories, whether they are tracking individual artists, researching album-level influence, or examining label activities.\n\n![Fig2. Node Type Count](images/2.png)\n\nUsers can interact with the year range slider to filter out nodes and edges based on release periods, which helps in isolating structural trends across time (e.g., growing presence of RecordLabel nodes in the 2020s).\n\n### 2. Genre Distribution of Songs (EDA Tab 5.3)\n\nThis bar chart allows users to examine the overall landscape of musical genres in the dataset. Users can place Oceanus Folk in relation to other genres by determining which genres are most represented, such as Dream Pop, Indie Folk, and Synthwave. This view can be used to evaluate niche representation, variety, and genre dominance across time by users conducting comparative genre analysis.\n\nTo refine this view, users can adjust the year range filter to see how genre dominance changes across time and use the Top N Genres input box to focus on the most relevant genres for their analysis.\n\n![Fig3. Genre Distribution of Songs](images/3.png)\n\n### 3. Oceanus Folk Song Release Trend (Tab 5.4)\n\nThis time series line graph displays the number of Oceanus Folk songs released per year, offering a lens into the temporal evolution of the genre. Users can use this chart to detect creative peaks, observe genre maturation, or identify influential periods (e.g., early 2010s surge).\n\nUsing the year range slider, users can focus on specific historical windows (e.g., post-2015 decline or pre-2000 emergence) to contextualize Oceanus Folk's rise and fall in relation to external events or shifts in the music scene.\n\n![Fig4. Oceanus Folk Song Release Trend](images/4.png)\n\n### 4. Genres Influenced by Oceanus Folk (Tab 5.5)\n\nThis bar chart visualizes the top genres that were influenced by Oceanus Folk, emphasizing the genre’s downstream cultural impact. Users can use this insight to understand how Oceanus Folk has shaped other genres like Indie Folk, Synthwave, and Dream Pop.\n\nThe year range filter again provides the ability to explore how Oceanus Folk’s influence evolves temporally, helping users distinguish between short-term spikes and long-term influence patterns.\n\n![Fig5. Genres Influenced by Oceanus Folk](images/5.png)\n\n### 5. Sailor Shift Influence Network (Sailor Shift Influence Tab)\n\nThis section presents two interactive network graphs. The left graph shows who influenced Sailor Shift and who she influenced, helping users track the bi-directional artistic relationships surrounding her. The right graph expands on this by showing how Sailor’s collaborators influenced or were influenced by others, uncovering broader influence pathways.\n\nUsers can interact with the node selection dropdown to focus on specific artists and explore sub-networks, which aids in investigating how artistic styles and collaborations have diffused through the genre network.\n\n![Fig6. Sailor Shift Influence Network](images/6.png)\n\n### 6. Oceanus Folk’s Influence Over Time\n\nThis section helps users track the spread of Oceanus Folk’s influence over time. The line plot visualizes the number of songs influenced by Oceanus Folk per year, while the accompanying data table offers detailed metadata including song names, artist names, genres, and release years.\n\nUsers can apply the year range slider to examine specific decades or artistic periods. The searchable data table enables users to filter for specific genres or artists for micro-level investigation, complementing macro trends with concrete examples.\n\n![Fig7. Oceanus Folk's Influence Over Time](images/7.png)\n\n### 7. Genres That Influenced Oceanus Folk\n\nThis radial network graph reveals which genres contributed to shaping Oceanus Folk. It helps users analyze the genre roots of Oceanus Folk, identifying key contributors such as Jazz Surf Rock, Synthpop, or Alternative Rock.\n\nBelow, the influence network diagram visualizes the entire graph of influences feeding into Oceanus Folk’s evolution. The dropdown selector allows users to highlight specific nodes, facilitating focused exploration of upstream artistic and genre pathways.\n\n![Fig8. Genres That Influenced Oceanus Folk](images/8.png)\n\n### 8. Rising Star Forecasting Module\n\nThis module provides predictive insights into future rising stars based on their genre alignment, influence connectivity, and release timelines. The timeline scatter plot maps notable artists’ upcoming releases, allowing users to assess genre engagement over time. The radar charts on the right summarize individual artist strengths across key metrics (e.g., Oceanus Folk alignment, collaborations, data stability).\n\nThe PCA clustering plot groups artists by shared characteristics, helping users identify distinct artist segments. Lastly, the network graph at the bottom right links rising artists to their works and collaborators, with a color-coded legend for node types.\n\nUsers can select specific artists or clusters to refine the analysis, making this module particularly useful for identifying under-the-radar artists or validating early-stage talent discovery.\n\n![Fig9. Rising Star Forecasting Module](images/9.png)\n\n# Skeleton Code for Shiny App\n\nThe Oceanus Music Influence Dashboard skeleton is a modular and scalable Shiny application designed to support interactive exploration of musical influence data. The structure provides a solid foundation for building a fully functional app by establishing key user interface elements, logical data partitions, and reactive components. It is streamlined to allow seamless expansion for more complex analytics and visualizations.\n\nThe skeleton organizes the user experience into four primary functional modules: **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Sailor Shift Influence**, **Oceanus Folk Influence**, and **Rising Star Forecasting**. Each module is represented as a tab in the user interface, with additional sub-tabs and visualizations integrated using `navlistPanel`, `plotOutput`, `plotlyOutput`, and `visNetworkOutput`.\n\nReactivity is introduced via `sliderInput`, `numericInput`, and tab-level selectors, allowing users to interact with year ranges and genre limits. This structure helps in filtering data dynamically, enabling a user-friendly and insightful exploration of trends, relationships, and patterns across various dimensions of the music dataset.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load Packages\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, jsonlite, plotly, visNetwork, DT, shiny)\n\n# Load Data\nkg <- fromJSON(\"MC1_release/MC1_graph.json\")\nnodes_tbl <- as_tibble(kg$nodes)\nedges_tbl <- as_tibble(kg$links)\n\n# Preprocessing (ID Mapping, Node & Edge Setup)\nid_map <- tibble(id = nodes_tbl$id, index = seq_len(nrow(nodes_tbl)))\nedges_tbl <- edges_tbl %>%\n  left_join(id_map, by = c(\"source\" = \"id\")) %>% rename(from = index) %>%\n  left_join(id_map, by = c(\"target\" = \"id\")) %>% rename(to = index)\n\n# Define UI\nui <- fluidPage(\n  titlePanel(\"Oceanus Music Influence Dashboard\"),\n  \n  tabsetPanel(id = \"main_tab\",\n              \n    tabPanel(\"Exploratory Data Analysis\",\n      fluidRow(\n        column(3,\n          navlistPanel(\n            tabPanel(\"Edge Type Count\"),\n            tabPanel(\"Node Type Count\"),\n            tabPanel(\"Genre Distribution of Songs\"),\n            tabPanel(\"Oceanus Folk Song Release Trend\"),\n            tabPanel(\"Genres Influenced by Oceanus Folk\")\n          ),\n          sliderInput(\"eda_year_range\", \"Year Range:\", 1980, 2035, c(1990, 2030)),\n          numericInput(\"top_n_genres\", \"Top N Genres:\", 10, min = 1, max = 50)\n        ),\n        column(9,\n          uiOutput(\"eda_plot_output\")\n        )\n      )\n    ),\n    \n    tabPanel(\"Sailor Shift Influence\",\n      fluidRow(\n        column(6, visNetworkOutput(\"sailor_network_1\")),\n        column(6, visNetworkOutput(\"sailor_network_2\"))\n      )\n    ),\n    \n    tabPanel(\"Oceanus Folk Influence\",\n      navlistPanel(widths = c(3, 9),\n        tabPanel(\"Oceanus Folk Influence on Others\",\n          sliderInput(\"year_range\", \"Year Range:\", 1980, 2035, c(1990, 2030)),\n          plotlyOutput(\"of_influence_plot\"),\n          DTOutput(\"of_influenced_table\")\n        ),\n        tabPanel(\"Others Influence on Oceanus Folk\",\n          visNetworkOutput(\"of_inward_genre_plot\", height = \"300px\"),\n          visNetworkOutput(\"of_network_plot\", height = \"500px\")\n        )\n      )\n    ),\n    \n    tabPanel(\"Rising Star Forecasting\",\n      fluidRow(\n        column(4,\n          selectInput(\"select_artist\", \"Select Artist\", choices = NULL),\n          selectInput(\"select_cluster\", \"Select Cluster\", choices = NULL)\n        ),\n        column(8,\n          plotOutput(\"timeline_plot\"),\n          plotOutput(\"pca_plot\"),\n          visNetworkOutput(\"rising_network\")\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n# Define Server\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  #
